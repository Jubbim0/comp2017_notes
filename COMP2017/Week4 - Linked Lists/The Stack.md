## The Stack
- In C, everything in the local scope of a function and its parameters are stored on the stack
- When a function is called the code:
	- Pushes arguments onto the stack
	- Push return address (where to return the result to) onto the stack
	- Jump to function code
- Inside the function the code:
	- Increment the stack pointer by the size of the local variables to allow for space
	- Executer the code
	- Pop local variables and arguments off the stack
	- Push the return result onto the stack
	- Jump to return address
